# Sockets With Python <br />
A simple demo program that has a socket server that can handle 2 clients. <br />
The clients, in this case, are 2 players in a pygame, which are simple squares. <br />
When one client moves his player, it is reflected in real-time to the other client as well. <br />

## How to use
1. Clone the repo <br />
2. Run server <br />
3. Run the first instance of client <br />
4. Run the second instance of client<br />
5. Done <br />

## Limitations
For now, the server only supports 2 clients at any given time.<br />
